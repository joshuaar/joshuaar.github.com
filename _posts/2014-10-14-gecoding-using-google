##What is Geocoding

Geocoding is the process of turning semi structured data (addresses, gps coordinates, street names, organization names) into GPS coordinates that can be placed on the map. Google has an [API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/) that does this very well.

##What's the catch?

Google only allows 2500 queries per day...bummer. Luckily we could spread these out into a bunch of Amazon or IPlant instances and make this little problem go away. I've written a [script](https://github.com/joshuaar/GeoCode)

It is well documented for anyone interested in a simple use of Google's GeoCoding API.

Stay tuned for an actual application of this technique to map Github users by language use.
